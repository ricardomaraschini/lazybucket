This is implementation of kinda leaky bucket.
Every function that needs to be controlled must
be first registered through RegisterFunction, once
the function is registered a go routine is dispatched.
This go routine is called feeder and its porpose is to
reset the counter for every registered function when
its time window is exhausted. We do not actually call
any external function here, we only control if they
can or can not be called using the IsAbleToCall
function.

The steps to use this package is: 1) get a new bucket
through GetBucket. 2) register a function within the
bucket suplying the max number of calls and also the
time window in seconds. 3) before every call to a
registered function you must check if you are able or
not by calling IsAbleToCall(). 4) at the end, unregister
